# SQL
A repo for SQL queries and commands are based on the book [Database Systems Concepts](https://www.db-book.com "Database Systems Concepts").
Queries and commands done in TDD in  node.js.
The tests are used to automatically load data for different conditions and validate the SQL outcomes  which is faster than manual filling.
The SQL queries are coded inside test functions that why there is only tests folder as the main folder.
## concepts covered include:
- Basic and intermediate CRUD operations.
- Complex querying such as query nesting and query reuse.
- Aggregation and Grouping.
- Set operations(union, intersection, etc).
- Validation and integrity constains.
- Relationships
- Views(lazy and materialized)
- Commands such as granting of privileges and Database performance analytics analytics.
