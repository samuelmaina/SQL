# SQL
Contains  SQL commands and queries done in TDD in  node.js.
The SQL commands and queries are based on the book [Database Systems Concepts](https://www.db-book.com "Database Systems Concepts")

The SQL queries are coded inside test functions that why I have only the  tests folder is the main folder.
