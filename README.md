# SQL
A repo for SQL queries and commands are based on the book [Database Systems Concepts](https://www.db-book.com "Database Systems Concepts").
Queries and commands done in TDD in  node.js.
The tests are used to automatically load data for different conditions, validate the SQL outcomes and clear the database. This is faster than manually filling the database and deleting the content.
The SQL queries are coded inside test functions that why there is only tests folder as the main folder.
## concepts covered include:
- Basic and intermediate CRUD operations.
- Complex querying such as query nesting and query reuse.
- Aggregation and Grouping.
- Set operations(UNION, INTERSECTION etc) and boolean operations(OR, AND and BETWEEN etc).
- Validation and integrity constains.
- Join operations (LEFT, RIGHT,NATURAL and INNER)
- Relationships.
- SQL functions and procedures.
